Now you're done
the next thing to do is to get the data we use in labs
unfortunately I couldn't upload it.

Getting the data shipped with the vm

vagrant up

ssh -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1 tar -czf data.tar.gz data
scp -P 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1:data.tar.gz .

the password is "vagrant"

and then upload it
